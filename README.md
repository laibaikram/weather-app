Certainly! Here's an example of a README guide for the weather app:

# Weather App

The Weather App is a simple Python application that provides current weather information for a given city. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data and displays it in a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Weather App, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- Requests library (install using `pip install requests`)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap:
   - Visit the OpenWeatherMap website (https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for a free account.
   - Once you have an account, navigate to your account dashboard and generate an API key.

3. Update the API key in the `weather_api.py` file:
   - Open the `weather_api.py` file in a text editor.
   - Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the following command to start the Weather App:

   ```bash
   python weather_app.py
   ```

3. The Weather App GUI window will open.

4. Enter the name of a city in the input field.

5. Click the "Get Weather" button to retrieve the weather information for the specified city.

6. The weather information, including weather conditions, description, temperature, and humidity, will be displayed on the screen.
